This is 1 of my previous projects that scrap website content with Python and Selenium ChromeDriver.

Mst of the websites could be run with headless browser, while few of them have to be run with non-headless one due to ajax pagination and image loading, or enhanced security countermeasures deployed by the websites such as random waiting time and redirection to Cloudflare page.

There are also cases that scraping is not quite feasible, such as when the captcha is needed, or there are limitation to the number of page to view or the number of images to download for each registered user account.
